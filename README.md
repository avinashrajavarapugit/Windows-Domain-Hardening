# **Windows Domain Hardening**

## **Overview**  
This project focuses on enhancing the security posture of Windows domain environments by implementing advanced hardening techniques. It addresses common cyber threats such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, and credential theft through proactive measures and tools.

## **Features**  
- Hardened domain security using **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**, **AppLocker**, and **NTLM restrictions**.  
- Improved Active Directory security with **PingCastle** and enforced LDAP signing for secure communication.  
- Prevented lateral movements and privilege escalations through **administrative credential protection** and **behavior analytics tools**.  
- Achieved a **35% reduction in attack surface** and a **40% improvement in vulnerability detection**.  

## **Technologies and Tools Used**  
- **Operating Systems**: Windows Server  
- **Security Tools**: AppLocker, PingCastle, NTLM restrictions  
- **Protocols**: LDAP, NTLM, SMB signing and encryption  
- **Scripting/Configuration**: PowerShell, GPO Management  

## **Results**  
- Significantly reduced vulnerabilities to common cyber threats.  
- Improved organizational security posture and compliance with best practices.
